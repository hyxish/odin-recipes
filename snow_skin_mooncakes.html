                <li>Using your hands knead the dough until the oil is completely absorbed</li>
                <li>Remove one-third of the dough and knead in raspberry powder</li>
                <li>Divide the white dough and pink dough into 5 equal parts</li>
                <li>Combine the pink and white dough together to form 5 balls and set aside</li>
